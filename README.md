# COVID-19 X-ray Image Classifier ðŸ¦ ðŸ“¸

Welcome to the COVID-19 X-ray Image Classifier repository! This project aims to classify X-ray images into Positive and Negative COVID-19 cases using deep learning techniques. Additionally, a user-friendly UI powered by Streamlit is provided for easy interaction with the model.

## Overview

The repository contains:

- **Python Scripts:** Python scripts for training the deep learning model, evaluating its performance, and making predictions.
- **Streamlit App:** User interface developed with Streamlit for uploading X-ray images and obtaining predictions.
- **Pre-trained Model:** Pre-trained deep learning model weights for quick inference.
- **Requirements.txt:** List of dependencies to install the required packages.
